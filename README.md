Daily Log
Rick and Morty API


Day 1: Research 
Today, I kicked off my project based on the world of "Rick and Morty." My initial focus was to thoroughly research the project requirements and gather relevant resources.
I went through the provided documentation and explored online resources to understand the expectations and best practices for tackling the project.
My objective today was to establish a solid understanding of what was expected and how I could begin developing my application.


Day 2: Initial Structure
On the second day of working on the project, I directed my efforts towards setting up the basic structure and overall design of the application.
I created the main HTML file that would serve as the foundation for my project. Additionally, I integrated the styles provided by Bootstrap to give my project a visually pleasing and cohesive look.
My aim for today was to establish a visual and structural skeleton that would enable me to progress towards building the different sections.


Day 3: Episodes Sidebar
Today, I dedicated my time to developing the episodes section of my application.
I created a sidebar that displays the list of available episodes using Bootstrap tools for formatting and styling.
Throughout this day, my main objective was to ensure that episodes were correctly presented and ready to interact with the user.


Day 4: Characters Section and Modals
Progressing to the fourth day, my focus expanded to developing the main characters section and connecting it to the episodes.
Using TypeScript, I formulated functions to retrieve character information from an API and designed the logic for displaying details in modals upon clicking character images.
Additionally, my aim was to link episodes to the characters section, enabling users to view characters related to specific episodes.


Day 5: Locations Section
The fifth day was dedicated to integrating the locations section, creating a dynamic link with the characters section.
I ensured that clicking on a character dynamically displayed related locations, creating a seamless experience for users.
The objective was to establish a robust foundation for the interconnectedness of characters and locations.


Day 6: Final Details
The sixth day focused on meticulous styling improvements to enhance the project's visual appeal.
I dedicated time to refining the project's CSS, striving to create an engaging and user-friendly interface.
Additionally, I reviewed and removed unused imports and exports, streamlining the codebase for clarity.
Today's primary focus was also on preparing for the project presentation, including writing this daily log and the video that will comprehensively showcase my work.


Conclusions:
"Rick and Morty API" has been a profound learning experience.
Each day represented a step forward, contributing to the development of an interactive application that intertwines characters, episodes, and locations from this television series.
It has helped me optimize my knowledge in JavaScript and learn TypeScript from scratch. I am grateful because I know these skills will serve me in the future as a web developer.
